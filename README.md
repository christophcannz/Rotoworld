Thank you for view this application .The goal of this app is to allow the user to view Sports news headlines from Rotoworld via the use of web scraping with MongoDB and Cheerio. The latest news will appear on the page and when the user clicks the "scrape" button, new headlines will refresh to the page. The user should also have the ability to save and delete articles by the click of a button. Due to some coding bugs, the headlines are not currently showing on the page. Please check back again for updates.
